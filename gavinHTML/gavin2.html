        <h1>Money is a problem with hunger</h1>
        <p>In the world we live in people want to help solve hunger.<br>however this is impossible without money.
        <br>food cant be made in this day and age without money, from farmers to ingredience and then supplying the food out to people.</p>

        <p>According to an estimate shared by Oxfam,<br>Around $23 billion is needed to fight <h2>extreme</h2>hunger.
        <br>Along with this another $14 Billion is needed to fight <h2>Chronic</h2>hunger.</p>
        <p>in both higher-wealth and low to middle income countries,are fine with dealing with hunger problems with the money they have.
        <br>most people who are hungry live in extreme poverty, defined as in income of $2.15 or less</p>

        <p>One of the most ambitions of the <br><h2>THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS</h2></p>
        <P>is to achieve zero hunger by 2030</P>
        <p>However, with less then a decade to go, the 2022 global hunger index noted that,
        <br>without a major shift the world as a whole, including the countries in particular,<br>
        wont reach "low" levels of hunger by then.</p>

        <h1>A FINANCIAL ASPECT TO SOLVING WORLD HUNGER WOULD BE......</h1>
        <p><h7>REDUCDE FOOD WASTE</h7></p>
        <p>We waste alot of food, and how we recieve and produce food is financial,<br>
        From the machinery, to the workers, to the land, there is a lot of money that goes into the food industry.<br>
        to help with the funding in poorer areas, what could be done is setting up anf funding facilities that take
        in food waste and recylce it to help with shortages of food</p>
        
        <p><h7>FUND LOCAL FARMS</h7></p>
        <p>farms are a huge part of food process, these places is where the food grows, like carrots or potatoes, and in order
        for this to happen, there is machinery involved, alot of local farms in poorer areas cannot afford this. This leads to crop shortages 
        especially in hot weather, as farmers<br> do not have the equipment to save crops. Governments in poor countries could fund these farms and help with crops,<br>
        once the crops are saved, then there may be a slight yet inclining change with hunger in these areas.</p>
        <img src="../images/happyfarmer.jpg" alt="happyfarmer">

        <P><h7>FUND IN BIODIVERSITY AND SUSTAINABILITY</h7></P>
        <P>If funding is put into biodiversity, this would see better varietys of crops to livestock,<br>
        A problem we have with this world is that import is too expensive, and in order to get new crops and livestock in would be <br>
        expensive, so funding in biodiversity would be a great way to helping hunger.<br>
        Along with this funding in a sustainable environment would mean that along with the growing and production of these crops and livestock <br>
        they would produce better, meaning crops would not die off, or livestock would not be high in meat nutriets,<br>
        due to livestock not having the nutriets (grass) in order to be healthy</P>

        <p><h7>FUND CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS</h7></p>
        <p>food organisations, which some are charitable organizations,<br>
        set up the likes of foodbanks, or fund poor areas with food that they have from kind donations of the public.
        They strive to help the hunger, even though it isnt fully effective in areas, it is still a massive help for an important cause.
        there are loads of organisations like this and in the next page i will discuss them.</p>
